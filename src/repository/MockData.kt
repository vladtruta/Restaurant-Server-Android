Since tandoori chicken is served in India without sauce, the next day the meat is usually tough and dried out. However, by stewing the chicken in a creamy tomato sauce full of spices, Indian chefs got the leftovers juicy and tasty again. Chicken tikka masala is actually the sister dish of butter chicken, which was also designed to preserve tandoori meat and keep it tender. \n" +
